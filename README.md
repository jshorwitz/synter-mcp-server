### The MCP extension Claude doesn't want you to use.

Because once you install it, your AI agent can spend real money.

Create campaigns. Adjust budgets. Pause underperformers. Generate creatives. Pull performance data. All through natural conversation—across Google, Meta, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, TikTok, and more.

**This is the first [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that gives AI agents a credit card.**

## Why Synter?

Most advertising MCP servers are **read-only** and **single-platform**. Synter is the only cross-platform ad management MCP server with full read + write capabilities:

| Feature | Synter | Google Ads MCP | Amazon Ads MCP | Others |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| **Platforms** | 9+ (Google, Meta, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Reddit, TikTok, X, StackAdapt, TTD) | Google only | Amazon only | 1-2 |
| **Create campaigns** | ✅ | ❌ Read-only | ✅ Amazon only | ❌ |
| **Adjust budgets** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Pause campaigns** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **AI creative generation** | ✅ (Imagen 4, Veo, Flux) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Bid optimization** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **AI Strategist** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Open source** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Varies |

One MCP server. Every ad platform. Read *and* write.

## ⚠️ Fair Warning

Your AI agent will be able to:
- **Create campaigns** that immediately start spending your budget
- **Adjust bids** that affect how much you pay per click
- **Pause campaigns** (sometimes that's a good thing)
- **Add keywords** that change who sees your ads
- **Generate creatives** and upload them to your accounts

We built in confirmations for destructive actions. But still—maybe don't give this to an agent you just met.

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your API Key

Sign up at [syntermedia.ai](https://syntermedia.ai) and create an API key in the [Developer Settings](https://syntermedia.ai/developer).

### 2. Configure Your AI Client

**For Claude Desktop** — Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@synterai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SYNTER_API_KEY": "syn_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Cursor** — Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@synterai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SYNTER_API_KEY": "syn_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Amp** — Add to `.amp/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "synter": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@synterai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "SYNTER_API_KEY": "syn_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Remote (Streamable HTTP)** — For ChatGPT, n8n, Zapier, or any MCP client that supports HTTP transport:

```
URL: https://mcp.syntermedia.ai/mcp/
Header: X-Synter-Key: syn_your_api_key_here
```

No local install needed. Works with any MCP client that supports [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) transport.

### 3. Start Using It

Restart your AI client and start chatting:

> "Show me all my Google Ads campaigns"

> "Create a search campaign for 'project management software' with a $50/day budget"

> "Pause the campaign that's overspending"

## No Ads Experience? No Problem.

If you've never run ads before, here's what you need to know:

### What is a Campaign?

A **campaign** is like a project folder. It contains your ads, who sees them, and how much you spend.

```
Campaign: "Q1 Lead Generation"
├── Budget: $50/day
├── Targeting: USA, people searching "project management"
└── Ads: Headlines, descriptions, images
```

### What Platforms Can I Use?

| Platform | Best For | Min Budget |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Google Ads** | People actively searching for your product | $10/day |
| **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** | Visual products, broad audiences | $5/day |
| **LinkedIn** | B2B, enterprise, job seekers | $25/day |
| **Reddit** | Niche communities, tech-savvy users | $5/day |
| **Microsoft (Bing)** | Older demographics, B2B | $10/day |
| **TikTok** | Gen Z, entertainment, e-commerce | $20/day |

### Campaign Types Explained

**Search Campaigns** — Your ad shows when someone Googles specific keywords.
- *Example:* Someone searches "best CRM software" → Your ad appears

**Display Campaigns** — Image ads shown across websites and apps.
- *Example:* Banner ad on a news site

**Performance Max (PMax)** — Google's AI shows your ads everywhere (Search, YouTube, Display, Gmail, Maps).
- *Example:* Google figures out the best placements for you

**Video Campaigns** — Video ads on YouTube and partner sites.
- *Example:* 15-second ad before a YouTube video

### Common Terms

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Impressions** | How many times your ad was shown |
| **Clicks** | How many people clicked your ad |
| **CTR** | Click-through rate (clicks ÷ impressions × 100) |
| **CPC** | Cost per click |
| **Conversions** | Desired actions (signups, purchases, etc.) |
| **ROAS** | Return on ad spend (revenue ÷ spend) |

### First Campaign Checklist

Before creating your first campaign, you'll need:

1. ✅ A landing page URL where people will go when they click
2. ✅ An idea of who you want to reach (location, interests)
3. ✅ A daily budget you're comfortable with ($10-50 to start)
4. ✅ Some headlines and descriptions for your ad

**Pro tip:** Start with a Search campaign on Google. It's the easiest to understand and shows ads to people already looking for what you offer.

---

## Example Conversations

### Create Your First Campaign

> **You:** Create a Google Search campaign for my SaaS product. Target people searching for "team collaboration software" and "project management tools". Budget is $25/day. Landing page is https://myapp.com/signup

> **Agent:** I'll create a Search campaign with those keywords. What headlines should I use? Here are some suggestions:
> - "Team Collaboration Made Simple"
> - "Project Management for Modern Teams"
> - "Start Free - No Credit Card"

### Check Performance

> **You:** How are my campaigns doing this week?

> **Agent:** Here's your performance for the last 7 days:
>
> | Campaign | Spend | Clicks | Conversions | ROAS |
> |----------|-------|--------|-------------|------|
> | Brand Search | $142 | 89 | 12 | 4.2x |
> | Competitor Keywords | $98 | 45 | 3 | 1.5x |
> | Display Retargeting | $67 | 234 | 8 | 2.8x |
>
> The "Competitor Keywords" campaign is underperforming. Want me to pause it or adjust the targeting?

### Add Negative Keywords

> **You:** I'm getting clicks for "free project management" but we don't have a free tier. Block those.

> **Agent:** Added "free" as a negative keyword to your campaign. This will stop your ads from showing for any search containing "free".

### Generate Ad Creative

> **You:** I need a display ad image for a marketing automation product. Dark theme, professional, 1200x628.

> **Agent:** Generating your image with Imagen 4...
>
> Created: "Marketing automation dashboard with data visualization on dark background"
> Asset saved and ready to use in your next Display campaign.

## Troubleshooting

### "SYNTER_API_KEY not set"

### "Invalid or expired API key"

2. Verify the key is active at [syntermedia.ai/developer](https://syntermedia.ai/developer)
3. Make sure the key has `tools:write` scope

### "No ad accounts connected"

You need to connect at least one ad platform:
1. Go to [syntermedia.ai/settings/credentials](https://syntermedia.ai/settings/credentials)
2. Click "Connect" next to Google Ads (or another platform)
3. Complete the OAuth authorization

### Tools aren't showing in Claude/Cursor

1. Restart your AI client completely (not just refresh)
2. Check the MCP server logs for errors
3. Verify the config file path and JSON syntax
